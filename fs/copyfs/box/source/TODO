Thoses features are planned for CopyFS 1.1 :
- new fversion options :
  * fversion cat file version_of_file
  * fversion delete file version_of_file
- new options when mounting the file system :
  * max number of versions to keep
  * max size to keep
  * what should be the oldest backup we keep
- logging options
- use diff between files, instead of keeping a full copy for each version.


For CopyFS 1.0.2 (only bugfix), the following bugs should be fixed :
 - When creating a file inside a suid directory, the new file should be
   in the same group as the directory.
 - When you delete a file, and create it again, permission is taken from
   the old file instead of using umask.
 - When trying to mount a version-directory that does not exist,
   copyfs-daemon exit without an error, and the directory still appears
   to be mounted. This should be fixed, and more checks should be added
   in copyfs-mount.
